/// <b>The ask has to outlive the asker.</b> <c>systemctl restart</c> without <c>--no-block</c> waits
/// for the job it queued, so systemd stops this process while <c>systemctl</c> is still waiting on it
/// and the job is left in whatever state the kill found. With <c>--no-block</c> the job is queued and
/// the command returns at once — systemd owns it from that moment, and this process going away is the
/// job proceeding rather than the job being lost.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The answer still reaches the caller.</b> Queueing returns in milliseconds and systemd then stops
/// the unit with SIGTERM, which is a graceful shutdown: the host drains the requests already in flight
/// before the process ends, and the one that asked for this is one of them. So the restart is queued
/// BEFORE the response is written, which is what lets the response carry whether it was accepted — a
/// refusal is a change written and not in force, and that is a state a person has to be told they are
/// in rather than left to infer from a connection that closed.

/// <b>Nobody is left to watch.</b> When a node's API changes a leaf it restarts a process it is not,
/// watches it come back and puts the old values back if it does not. A component restarting itself has
/// no such observer — the process that would poll is the one being restarted — so a value that stops it
/// starting stops it starting, and recovery is removing the override file on the machine. That path is
/// logged before the restart is asked for, for exactly that moment.
